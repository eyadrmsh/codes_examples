In this file I added files that I created while lemmatizing db tweets:

# Lemmatization_reserach.ipynb

In this file I created function for downloading, cleaning, and after lemmatizing tweets (for Stanza ans Spacy packages). Also I tried to experiment and customize pipiline for text processing. In the result it was decided to use spacy package, since it was less aggressive. 

# Script_for_lemmatizing_db.py

In this file you can see a script for leammtizing a db in batches adapted to SBATCH
